DESCRIPTION:
Small project for showcase of my abilities with html, css PHP and javascript.
Project is a website with multiple users, where images can be uploaded and deleted (and viewed).
Also new users can be created online and images can be filtered through a searchbar text. 
Only the user that uploaded the image can delete it. 
To view the site online click on the url above. 
If you wish to host it locally you can download the project and use the
localhost adress given above for convenience, also modify the file in the note below.
-----------------------
NOTE: In case of error when setting up the site, look for constants.php and create a database
with the according name and user, OR change the file to suit database and user to your needs.
